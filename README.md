# waveset-player--for-trevor-wishart-


This creates an interface in SuperCollider for working with all of the waveset transformations described by Trevor Wishart, as recounted by Curtis Road in *Microsound*, plus a few weird ones I found along the way.

You will have to have [the waveset quark]([https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Wavesets](https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Wavesets)) installed.
